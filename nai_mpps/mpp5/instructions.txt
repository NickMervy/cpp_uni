Implement the Naive Bayesian Classifier for iris data.

Input data:

Training data – iris_training.txt

Test data – plik iris_test.txt
Classify each case using the Naive Bayesian Classifier. Establish the confusion matrix. Compute all four performance measures in percent. Discuss the results.
Your program must allow for an interactive input of new cases’ attribute values for their classification until the user quits.
No third party ML libraries or tools are permitted, everything musch be coded from scratch.
