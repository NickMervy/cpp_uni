Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) is an American aerospace manufacturer and space transportation services company headquartered in Hawthorne, California. It was founded in  by Elon Musk with the goal of reducing space transportation costs to enable the colonization of Mars. SpaceX manufactures the Falcon  and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles, several rocket engines, Dragon cargo and crew spacecraft and Starlink satellites.

SpaceX's achievements include the first privately funded liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit (Falcon  in ), the first private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft (Dragon in ), the first private company to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station (Dragon in ), the first vertical take-off and vertical propulsive landing for an orbital rocket (Falcon  in ), the first reuse of an orbital rocket (Falcon  in ), and the first private company to send astronauts to orbit and to the International Space Station (SpaceX Crew Dragon Demo- and SpaceX Crew- missions in ). SpaceX has flown and reflown the Falcon  series of rockets over one hundred times.

SpaceX is developing a large internet satellite constellation named Starlink. In January  the Starlink constellation became the largest satellite constellation in the world. SpaceX is also developing Starship, a privately funded super heavy-lift launch system for interplanetary spaceflight. Starship is intended to become the primary SpaceX orbital vehicle once operational, supplanting the existing Falcon , Falcon Heavy and Dragon fleet. Starship will be fully reusable and will have the highest payload capacity of any orbital rocket ever on its debut, scheduled for the early s.
In  Elon Musk conceptualized Mars Oasis, a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse and grow plants on Mars. He announced that the project would be "the furthest that life's ever traveled" in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration and increase the budget of NASA. Musk tried to purchase cheap rockets from Russia but returned empty-handed after failing to find rockets for an affordable price.

On the flight home Musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed. According to early Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson, Musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket were only % of the sales price of a rocket at the time. By applying vertical integration, producing around % of launch hardware in-house, and the modular approach of modern software engineering, Musk believed SpaceX could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a % gross margin.

In early  Musk started to look for staff for his new space company, soon to be named SpaceX. Musk approached rocket engineer Tom Mueller (later SpaceX's CTO of propulsion), and invited him to become his business partner. Mueller agreed to work for Musk, and thus SpaceX was born. SpaceX was first headquartered in a warehouse in El Segundo, California. By November , the company had  employees.

Musk has stated that one of his goals with SpaceX is to decrease the cost and improve the reliability of access to space, ultimately by a factor of ten.
