Perform a k-means clustering algorithm on the iris data.


Ignore the decision attribute while clustering.


The parameter k - number of groups - must be entered by the user.

Your program must display:

With each iteration: For each cluster - the sum of squares of distances from members to the cluster center.
At the end: The cardinality of each cluster along with their entropy (computed on the distribution of the decision attribute within that cluster).
