Implement the brute force solution to the knapsack problem.

Input data: File knapsack.txt  containing 15 datasets.
We randomly choose a number from 1 to 15 for a dataset.
Output the content of the best knapsack found (a list of [nr, size, value] triples), 
its total value and capasity used, and the execution time.
